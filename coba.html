                <b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <a href="#">markup language <sup>[a]</sup></a> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href="#">web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of <a href="#">web content</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="#">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) and <a href="#">scripting languages</a> such as <a href="#">JavaScript</a>, a programming language.

            <p>
                <a href="#">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href="#">web server</a> or from local storage and <a href="#">render</a> the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <a href="#">web page semantically</a> and originally included cues for its appearance.

                In 1980, <a href="#">physicist Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at <a href="#">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="#">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="#">Internet</a>-based <a href="#">hypertext</a> system.<a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a>Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN <a href="#">data systems</a> engineer <a href="#">Robert Cailliau</a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an <a href="#">encyclopedia</a> is the first entry. <a href="#"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

                                HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:

                                HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[17]Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[14] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.
